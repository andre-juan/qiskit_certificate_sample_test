# Qiskit certification - sample test solution

In this repository, I present a coded solution to all questions in the Qiskit certification sample test, available [here.](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300) In this link you can also find more information regarding the certification and the exam.

Each one of the questions (even the "theoretical" ones) is solved using Qiskit. I also present some additional functions (which may be useful for your Qiskit projects!) and additional explorations, following the study guide (also available in the link above).

I wrote this notebook when I was studying for the certification exam, and it was very helpful to review Qiskit's functionalities in a more directed way. Hopefully, this code will help not only those preparing for the test, but also everyone interested in learning more about Qiskit and its functionalities!

This repository contains the following files:

- `qiskit_certification_sample_test_solution.ipynb` - notebook file with the solutions to the sample test, auxiliary functions and further explorations, following the study guide;
- `qasm_test` - file with a qasm string associated with a test quantum circuit. This is used in the "further explorations" section.
